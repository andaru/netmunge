# netmunge #

`netmunge` is a Python library that wraps up network element output parsers (generated from Yapps v2 grammars) into an easy to use system for parsing router output and emitting data tuples from the parsed results.

`netmunge` can be used for things like producing CSV output from router `show` commands, for tactical network operations duties in a NOC, for auditing router operational state or parsing element configuration.
